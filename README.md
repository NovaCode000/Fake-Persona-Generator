## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Python 3.x:** You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  * **Git:** If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).

### Installation and Usage

Follow these simple steps to get SockPuppet up and running:

1.  **Download the Tool:**
    Open your terminal or Git Bash and clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SockPuppet.git
    ```

    (Replace `your-username` and `SockPuppet` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Navigate to the Tool's Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned `SockPuppet` folder:

    ```bash
    cd SockPuppet
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies (if any):**
    If your tool relies on any Python libraries, you'll need to install them. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies (if you have a requirements.txt file)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, list any necessary `pip install` commands here (e.g., `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`).

4.  **Run the Tool:**
    Now you can run the SockPuppet tool.

    ```bash
    python your_tool_script_name.py
    ```

    (Replace `your_tool_script_name.py` with the actual name of your main Python script, e.g., `main.py` or `sockpuppet.py`).

### Basic Commands

Once the tool is running, you can use the following commands to interact with it:

  * **[Command 1]:** `command_name` - Briefly explain what this command does.
      * Example: `create_profile --name "JohnDoe" --platform "Twitter"` - Creates a new sockpuppet profile for Twitter named "JohnDoe".
  * **[Command 2]:** `another_command` - Briefly explain what this command does.
      * Example: `list_profiles` - Displays a list of all managed sockpuppet profiles.
  * **[Command 3]:** `yet_another_command <argument>` - Briefly explain what this command does, including any arguments.
      * Example: `deploy_profile --id 123 --target "example.com"` - Deploys the profile with ID 123 to interact with example.com.
  * **[Add more commands as needed, with examples]**
  * **`help` (or similar):** Most command-line tools have a `help` command or flag (`-h`, `--help`) to show available options. Mention how users can get help within your tool.
